        Pulsar is introducing the Sustainability commitment: Pulsar's efforts to promote a clean, environmentally friendly, and beneficial service to all. 
<br><br>-We run our facilities on Earth completely off of renewable energy sources; it is a combination of many different sources, most notably solar and hydropower. 
<br><br>-Our buildings are LEED-certified.
<br><br>-Our rockets and spacecraft run on completely clean fuel with 0 emissions. 
<br><br>-Our spacecraft and machinery is made of recycled steel and other metals: and yes, they are still 100% safe!
<br><br>-The Pulsar conservation commitment seeks to plant thousands of new trees every year to give back to the environment. We hope to see you all in one of our events!

We hope to join other innovators and pioneers of the industry in promoting the incredible and stunning nature of space, but it is important to ensure sustainability while conducting our efforts. We hope these factors are able to help combat climate change and contribute to a healthier and cleaner industry.
